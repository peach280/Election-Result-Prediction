Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Election Result Prediction

This project leverages sentiment analysis on Twitter data to analyze public sentiment toward political parties, specifically the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) and Congress (Indian National Congress) in the lead-up to 
the 2024 Maharashtra Elections. By examining tweets about the two parties, this tool provides insights into public perception and sentiment trends that can influence electoral outcomes. The analysis categorizes 
sentiments into three broad groups: positive, negative, and neutral.

The goal of this project is to track the sentiment dynamics of the two parties, helping predict their potential performance in the upcoming elections based on Twitter engagement.
