Based on the twitter sentiment analysis, it can be predicted that BJP(Mahayuti coalition) is likely to perform better in the
upcoming election compared to Congress(MVA Alliance), given the more favorable sentiment reflected in the scores.

It may also mean bot accounts were used to like the tweets.
In some of the reports(like the one taken by sentiment) Congress was seen as winner.
Overall the competition is expected to be tight.


This analysis provides a preliminary prediction based on sentiment scores, but it should be complemented with other factors
such as ground realities, campaign strategies, and voter turnout to make a more accurate prediction.It's important to
note that sentiment analysis can be subject to various biases and fluctuations
